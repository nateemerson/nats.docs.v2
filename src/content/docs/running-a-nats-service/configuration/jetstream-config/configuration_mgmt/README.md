# Configuration Management

In many cases managing the configuration in your application code is the best model, many teams though wish to pre-create Streams and Consumers.

We support a number of tools to assist with this:

* [CLI with Configuration Files](nats-admin-cli)
* [Terraform](terraform)
* [GitHub Actions](github_actions)
* [Kubernetes JetStream Controller](kubernetes_controller)
